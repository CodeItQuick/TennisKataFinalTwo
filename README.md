# Tennis Refactoring Kata

I've only done TennisGame2 so far. I think I like my answer. Most of the refactors were done safely, at
this point for me its mostly about being happy with the end product.

The second TennisGame2 had unnecessarily complexity in the if statements which I believe I eliminated.
